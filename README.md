Here you can find my very first website.

I was using html5, css3, jquery, and javascript. I am most satisfied with the friendly design, RWD and functionalities like sorting the gallery by class, fading out the bar navigation when you're scrolling down and fades in when scrolling up.
I didn't want to use bootstrap or foundation in the first project because I wanted to learn basics and later on use frameworks. I also had to learn how to use basic functionalities of photoshop.

I wanted to improve the filter gallery ny adding functionality to shuffle images, and I did it but another problem occurred.
When the event was fired - images were shuffled but after using another filter in gallery (eg btn - NATURE) images didn't t appear, they showed up when I used the "All photos" button, but even after this something is broken. Maybe if it could be generated dynamicly it could be solved.

It was done by using an array
